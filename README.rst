## Dependencies 
# Dependencies
All dependencies can be found in the package lock <br/>
Please note this bot is written in discord.js so the master branch for the bot is needed. <br/>
Simply download the bot and cd into the file location then use npm install. <br/>
SQL is also required as commands and upcoming use and will use it. <br/>
An alternate route is quick.db which is used in some commands and is much easier. <br/>
I find it easier to work with quick.db with server id's for tables instead of sql, so this is also required. <br/>
Finally the command handler is done by DJS-COMMANDS, this is a requirement as commands will not work without this! <br/>
